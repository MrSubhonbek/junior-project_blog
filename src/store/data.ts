                    'Japan is truly a year-round destination, and Japanese culture is remarkable in its profound appreciation of the changing of the seasons. As you’ll see when you visit, each season — and even sub-season! — is celebrated with seasonal foods, and often matsuri (festivals). Because of this, we typically recommend taking advantage of any chance to visit Japan.',
                    'On the other hand, if your dates are flexible it’s worth thinking about which time of year you might enjoy most. After all, some travelers hate the cold — or the heat and humidity of summer — while others will do whatever it takes to avoid crowds! (When planning a trip to Japan, a key question to ask yourself is: would you rather have better weather, or fewer tourists around?)',
                    'Because there is so much to consider, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide on the best time to travel to Japan, including information on the seasons, weather, national holidays to look out for, and more.'

                    'The best time to visit Japan is generally considered to be between March and May, or October and November. However, it depends on your interests and what you’re planning to do during your trip. While many travelers prefer to avoid the heat and humidity of summer, or cold of winter, you might be an exception if you’re interested in summer matsuri (festivals) or winter onsen (hot springs), skiing, and snowboarding.',

                    'Spring in Japan is famous for the cherry blossom season, and if you’re lucky — and don’t mind the crowds — you may experience hanami (cherry-blossom viewing) in all its glory. This romantic time of year is popular for honeymoons in Japan.',
                    'Summer is arguably the most festive time of year, with colorful matsuri (festivals) throughout the country, the chance to hike in the mountains, and lovely coastal areas where you can enjoy the sea.',
                    'Fall in Japan is another magical (and highly popular) time of year, with brilliant autumn colors and crisp, pleasant temperatures.',
                    'Winter in Japan offers amazing seafood, incredible onsen (hot springs) experiences, not to mention some of the best powder in the world for skiing and snowboarding.',

                    'The West-Midlands city of Coventry is more known as a centre for industry rather than tourism. After the city and most of its historical buildings were destroyed in the Blitz, you may wonder why you would wish to book into a hotel in Coventry at all. Well, the ninth largest city in England has reconstructed itself since as a centre for multiculturalism and industrial heritage and is a home for two universities. It is now only an hour away from London and close to Birmingham’s International Airport and National Exhibition Centre, as well as the fabulous Warwick Castle.',

                    'Coventry is located in central England near no less than four motorways – the M6, M69, M45 and M40 - linking it to all corners of the country. London Euston can be reached in an hour by train and the UK’s second largest city – Birmingham in half that time. You can also get to Birmingham International Airport and National Exhibition Centre in just ten minutes, making it a convenient place to stop over and grab a meal before or after a flight, concert or exhibition. There are numerous bed and breakfasts, lodges and hotels near Coventry’s railway station and a further concentration on the main road to Birmingham. Although much smaller than Birmingham’s, Coventry also has its very own airport with flights to some popular holiday resorts.',
                    'The modern city centre is a nice manageable size – not overwhelming, yet with a good range of shops and international restaurants. With its high multicultural population, you’ll find some authentic curry and Balti houses, as well as Caribbean cuisine. There are also a good few leisure and cultural attractions to keep you occupied.',

                    'Coventry is a city of hope, survival and rejuvenation fueled by the passion of its people. Centuries-old monuments, art galleries and museums bring to life its two golden ages. A thriving wool town in the Middle Ages, Coventry was a world-leader in car manufacturing in the 1800s and 1900s. German bomb raids devastated the city in 1940 and the demise of the British car industry brought hardship, but it has since bounced back to become a vibrant cultural destination.',
                    'Antiquity abounds in the Cathedral Quarter, a compact district with landmark buildings. Coventry Cathedral has both the ruins of a 14th-century cathedral and a new modernist church. See the relics of the city’s first cathedral at the Priory Visitor Centre and admire Doom artwork at the Holy Trinity Church. St. Mary’s Guildhall is a fine example of a medieval guildhall and Herbert Art Gallery and Museum celebrates local history.',
                    'Stroll to Broadgate, a pedestrianized plaza dominated by the Lady Godiva Statue. The statue honors the folkloric tale of Godiva, Countess of Mercia, who rode naked on horseback through the city streets. Brand-name retailers, boutiques, cafés, pubs and malls line the streets of the surrounding precinct. Shop for fresh produce and flowers, handmade jewelry, second-hand clothes and toys at Coventry Market.',
                    'Learn about the city’s importance to the bike and car-manufacturing industries at Coventry Transport Museum. Nearby Cook Street Gate and Swanswell Gate are the sole-surviving gates of a 14th-century defensive wall. On Spon Street a collection of restored half-timbered houses hark back to medieval times.
