However, it depends on your interests and what you’re planning to do during your trip.

                    'Summer is arguably the most festive time of year, with colorful matsuri (festivals) throughout the country, the chance to hike in the mountains, and lovely coastal areas where you can enjoy the sea.',
                    'Fall in Japan is another magical (and highly popular) time of year, with brilliant autumn colors and crisp, pleasant temperatures.',
                    'Winter in Japan offers amazing seafood, incredible onsen (hot springs) experiences, not to mention some of the best powder in the world for skiing and snowboarding.',
